# Rock Paper Scissors x99

A variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors you can play within the browser. With an overly complex if-else logic written in JavaScript for the code for the game-logic. (`./js/game-logic.js`)

## Getting Started

Download the repository and open index.html in your favorite browser. (Chrome works best.) You can see the main screen and play from there, either against the computer or another human player.

### Game rules

This game is just like the famous 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' you all know and love. Except set up into three rounds where players pick their moves before the game begins and ties are settled through a point allocation system. In other words, if two players both pick paper, the player with the higher number wins the tie.

## Testing

A testing suite is provided to verify all the essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install
all necessary testing dependencies (you will only need to do this step once).
Finally, run `npm run test` to see the test results and information about each one.
